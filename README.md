# Skills test

This is short skills test, it's nothing too intesive but is designed to give creative freedom over how you approach a task

### Before you begin

1. Fork this repository so you have your own working copy

### Then do one of the following

Either

*A)* In the 'site' directory, mock up the provided PDF design in HTML, CSS and JS. Extra points for validation.

Or

*B)* In the 'api' directory, write a webservice method that accepts Northings and Eastings, converts them to Lat/Long and reverse geocodes to an address, outputing the result as XML or JSON (or both!)

Remember you only need to complete one of the tasks.

### Finally

We want to see your results so to submit your work:

1. Commit and push your code to your own repository
1. Send us a pull request with your result

Happy coding and good luck!
